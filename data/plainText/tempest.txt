Miranda: If by your art, my dearest father, you have 
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. 
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, 
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, 
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered 
With those that I saw suffer -- a brave vessel, 

Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, 
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock 
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd. 
Had I been any god of power, I would 
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere 
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and 
The fraughting souls within her.

Prospero: Be collected: 
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart 
There's no harm done. 

Miranda: O, woe the day!

Prospero: No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee, 
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who 
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing 
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better 
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, 
And thy no greater father.

Miranda: More to know 
Did never meddle with my thoughts. 

Prospero: 'Tis time 
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, 
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:

[Lays down his mantle] 

Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. 
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd 
The very virtue of compassion in thee, 
I have with such provision in mine art 
So safely ordered that there is no soulâ€” 
No, not so much perdition as an hair 
Betid to any creature in the vessel 
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down; 
For thou must now know farther.
