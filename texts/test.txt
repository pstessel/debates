conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). As a
reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly
Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood (VP of IR):
Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth-quarter 2015 conference call. Today's call is being
webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave
Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. During our prepared remarks, Dave will
provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory
review, we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments
today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These
matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our
forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, recent current reports on Form
8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or

update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP
financial measures and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact
of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measures are included in our fourth-quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now I will
turn the call over to Dave. Dave.
Dave Lesar (CEO):
Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in
2015. First, total Company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35%
decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completion spend. And even
though it was a very tough market, I am pleased to say that, once again, we outpaced our peer group in
North America and internationally, both sequentially and on a full-year basis. I am especially pleased
with the resilience of our international business. Despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions
and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless
focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peers sequentially and on a full-year basis
in both revenue and in margins. And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year where
we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our
performance. From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative
to a 64% reduction in the US land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to
quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the
quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without
reaching a settlement or the DoJ initiating litigation. In December, the DoJ informed us that they do not
believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DoJ's concerns,
but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals. With respect to the European Commission,
the review has entered phase 2, which was anticipated and we recently advised the Commission that we
plan to formally propose remedies which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns. Earlier this
month, Halliburton presented to the DoJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their
approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the
enhanced divestiture package. The sales process for the planned divestiture continues and we are in
discussions with interested buyers. There is no agreement to date with the DoJ or EC as to the adequacy
of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations with the DoJ and the EC and other enforcement
authorities continue with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible.
Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time
required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we
believe the compelling strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination
continues to remain intact. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for
our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve
substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost
services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers' oil services needs
and help them operate more cost effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of
the energy industry and oil and gas prices. Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to
obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing
the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30, the
merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory
approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement. Now, let me discuss what we're seeing
in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss
our fourth-quarter results in more detail. Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that
I've seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged
in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late 1980s that global upstream spending will decline for

two consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be
cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans.
Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively
influencing customer plans in the near term. On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the
most impacted in 2016. Third-party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year
decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50% and that's on top of the estimated 40%
decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is, due to the macro uncertainties, many of our
customers are managing their businesses in real time, rig by rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this
market week by week and in some cases crew by crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have
confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price. Now there are a number of moving parts in North
America and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery. But we do expect
that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will continue to execute our
playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions while also positioning our North America land
business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers. The
international markets held up much better than North America in 2015. But they are also not immune to
the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third-party surveys for international spend indicate a
decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We're working diligently with
our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency, but
do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout
the year. Now looking at our geographies, we expect activity in the Middle East/Asia region to again be
the most resilient in 2016 as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are
anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be
impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to
experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016 with the most vulnerable areas being the
North Sea and Angola where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics.
Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the
adoption of new standards for production systems, but these are structural changes that will take time to
fully implement. And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region with the largest
declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is
currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets. So in
summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you we'll do what we
have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will. We believe our customers will
remain focused on cost per barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which
bode very well for Halliburton. Now it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has
visibility of the trough, the recovery will come into view and when it does, we expect the recovery will
play out very similar to others where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the
international markets where the rebound will be more methodical. Now let me turn the call over to
Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian.
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth-quarter results
to the third quarter of 2015. Total Company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline while
operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. All regions experienced revenue declines during the
quarter led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our
international business, fourth-quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10%
respectively as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter.
Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year-end
equipment and software sales. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% with a similar
decline in operating income of 6%. Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially
offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman. Turning to

Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw the fourth-quarter revenue decline by 6% with a decrease in operating income
of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea,
partially offset by higher activity in Angola and Algeria. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw the fourthquarter
revenue decline by 6% with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter
was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity in
Angola and Algeria. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9% respectively
driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region. Partially offsetting this decline was improved
activity levels in Mexico. Moving to North America, revenue declined 13% with operating margins
improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the US land was the primary
driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement
was primarily due to a spike in year-end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected
to repeat in the first quarter. Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost-reduction efforts and
minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. (technical difficulty)
Jef f Miller (President):
(audio in progress) represent years of research through a disciplined, multistage, gate program and
although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's
important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. Through joint
reach projects with our customers and by elevating field developed solutions, Halliburton is among the
more efficient innovators in any industry. Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&amp;D cost
of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of R&amp;D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on
intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global US patent leaders. And finally,
superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell
you that in a market like this a timely efficient job can be the difference between an economic well and
an uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by
service quality. Or simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain the work. Now looking at
2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of
improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit
reductions from 2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're
improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We're refining our
processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You'll
be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a one-time event. It's the relentless focus on
efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company. We believe that these
elements -- our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality
-- provide a strong foundation for our business. We're confident that by executing on our strategy and
building on the successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and
when the recovery comes. Now let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing comments. Dave.
Dave Lesar (CEO):
Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum it up. As I said, 2016 is shaping up to be one tough slog through the mud and the
industry is going to have to take it a quarter at a time. We have a seasoned management team and a
proven playbook that has served us well during previous cycles and we're entering the year from a
position of strength with a solid financial position. We're focused on maintaining a strong customer
portfolio, investing in more efficient technology and delivering reliable, best-in-class service quality for
our customers and are preparing the business for growth when the industry recovers. And as we
demonstrated this year, whatever the market gives us, we will take it and then take some more. And
finally, we remain fully committed to closing the pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. We are diligently
focused on the regulatory reviews, the divestiture process and planning for integration activities after we
close the deal. So with that, let's open it up for questions.

QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS
Operator:
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). James West, Evercore.
James West (Analyst - Evercore):
So Jeff, really impressed with the international operations in 2015 -- growing margins, outperforming on
the revenue decline. Obviously, there's a lot of cost management going on there. Could you maybe
highlight a little bit further how you guys were able to outperform and what 2016 looks like in terms of
your ability to continue to outperform?
Jef f Miller (President):
Thank you, James. It really is around aggressive cost control. And we've been outperforming for a number
of quarters. This looks like winning the right contracts and managing the heck out of the costs most
certainly and it's also a mature field strategy in action. A big piece of this is mature fields and where we
see the benefit of scope, scale and that clarity of strategy, it's a recipe for success. So really pleased with
the performance and that team is right on top of their business.
James West (Analyst - Evercore):
And you think that outperformance could continue as we go through 2016?
Jef f Miller (President):
Yes. So if we look at 2016, it will be a tougher slog in 2016, no question. We're seeing fairly constant
pressure around negotiation and tenders, but, in some cases, we are having what I would say positive
collaborative discussions with clients around how to reduce uncertainty, increase system efficiency. So
certainly pleased with our performance right now.
James West (Analyst - Evercore):
Got it. Thanks.
Operator:
Jud Bailey, Wells Fargo.
Jud Bailey (Analyst - Wells Fargo):
Follow-up question on some of the international commentary earlier, specifically Latin America. I think
there was a sequential revenue decline somewhere in the mid-teens. Christian or Dave, could you maybe
give us a little bit of color? Is that based on activity declines? Is it pricing, both, or do you have any other
major projects that may be rolling off? Just maybe a little more commentary over what's driving Latin
America at least in the first quarter.
Christian Garcia (CFO):
So in Latin America, if you look at our sequential declines, it was 6%, down 6%. It was driven by almost all
countries except for Mexico. Now on a productline by productline basis, we had actually good landmark
in (inaudible); however, we also had some expenses associated with our vessels in Mexico.

Maybe one further comment. Across the piece, it's a tough slog in Latin America. Nearly every country is
facing some sort of particular challenge whether it's macroeconomic or just pure facing down commodity
price, which is an example for a Colombia, for example. So we're seeing historical lows in terms of rig
activity in a couple of countries and I don't see that changing.
Jud Bailey (Analyst - Wells Fargo):
Okay. I guess I was more referencing the first quarter, some of the commentary. Didn't you say, Christian,
mid-teens sequential decline for revenue?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Yes, that is absolutely correct. And it's because of the macro headwinds that Latin America is facing. As
Dave pointed out, Latin America will probably be the most challenged international region that we have
and it's particularly acute in Mexico and Brazil.
Jud Bailey (Analyst - Wells Fargo):
Okay. All right. And my follow-up, Dave, maybe if you could maybe talk a little more about North America
and I guess specifically the nature of discussions with customers and maybe how those are evolving with
commodity prices to start the year. They are obviously going through a number of different budget
initiatives. Maybe you could talk a little bit about any visibility that you have or don't have and what
customers are communicating and how they are thinking about the first half of 2016 in North America.
Dave Lesar (CEO):
Yes, I'm talking almost every day with the CEOs of our customers and I would say that it's a real challenge
out there. And I guess the way I would sum it up is there is sort of a constant revision of budgets going on
and those revisions are clearly with a downward bias. So the way I would describe it is, right now, our
customers don't know what they are going to spend, where they are going to spend it and when they are
going to spend it in North America at this point in time, which is why I made the comment earlier we really
are trying to run the business on literally a week-by-week, crew-by-crew, unit-by-unit basis until our
customers see some stability in pricing where they can then put a stake in the ground. But until they can
put that stake in the ground, we're just going to have to remain very flexible and I like our chances in
that kind of a market.
Jud Bailey (Analyst - Wells Fargo):
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
Angie Sedita, UBS.
Angie Sedita (Analyst - UBS):
Good morning, guys and certainly I echo James' comments on a very impressive quarter and year given
overall market conditions. So a little bit of granularity on the US pressure pumping market. In the past,
you've done some work on the potential level of attrition, specifically for pumps and engines versus fluid
ends, so any color further on the attrition side? And are you starting to see a change of behavior by the
small pressure pumpers where they are starting to become more aggressive in either pulling out of the
market or on the cost side, or can they?

Attrition is really the story here and consistent with remarks before, we see today about half the
equipment is idled. That's equipment that's not being maintained and is being cannibalized for parts
more broadly. The service intensity, believe it or not, continues to creep up. So we saw a 9% sequential
increase in profit pumped on a per well basis, which means equipment is working harder than it ever has.
We estimate 4 million to 6 million horsepower that will be out of the market by the second half of 2016. My
gut says we're at the top end of that range right now. And this is really why we're committed to Frac of the
Future. It's the cost of the pump and it's the total operating cost of the equipment that matters, in my
view, the most and that's what will have Halliburton best positioned for the recovery.
Angie Sedita (Analyst - UBS):
Okay, very, very helpful. And then any change in behavior with the small guys given where their margins
are and [overall] profitability, or status quo with what you saw in the second half of 2015?
Jef f Miller (President):
We don't see ourselves as competing with that group, but they are certainly aggressive in the
marketplace. We haven't seen them back off. But, again, this is the reason why we have strategically
invested in Frac of the Future and surface efficiency and then the custom chemistry that we deliver. I
talked about some of that in my earlier comments. Those are the things that differentiate Halliburton.
Angie Sedita (Analyst - UBS):
Okay, perfect. And then as an unrelated follow-up, on the merger, obviously, you can't talk about the
regulatory process, but, Dave and Mark, you've commented in the past that you've reiterated your
confidence on the cost synergies with Baker cutting pretty aggressively as well on the cost side. Can you
talk about the cost synergies, your confidence there into 2016/2017?
Dave Lesar (CEO):
Angie, I don't want to elaborate anymore, but the cost synergy story stays intact.
Angie Sedita (Analyst - UBS):
Okay, perfect. Thanks. I'll turn it over.

David Anderson (Analyst - Barclays):
So you mentioned several mature field projects in the Middle East, I think, you said are poised to move
ahead. How do you think the Baker Hughes transaction is having an impact on bidding of this type of
work? I guess I'm just kind of wondering, with the uncertainty around the divestitures, it must make it a bit
challenging for both you and your customers in terms of putting together and evaluating bids. Can you
just talk a little bit about how this is being handled?
Dave Lesar (CEO):
Yes. Dave, as you can appreciate, I don't think we want to go there.

Dave Lesar (CEO):
They still compete with us. We're still running our companies separately and they are in the market
making their own pricing decisions and where they tender and how they tender, and we don't have any
visibility into that.
David Anderson (Analyst - Barclays):
Okay. On a separate subject on North America, on your North American margins, I noticed the D&amp;E
margins in North America improved quite a bit this quarter. C&amp;P was more or less as expected. I think
you said in the release it was something to do with offshore. Can you expand a bit? Obviously, it wasn't
the completion sales. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on? Is that a trend we should be
expecting and maybe kind of your outlook on how you are seeing the Gulf of Mexico this year?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
So on your question around D&amp;E, D&amp;E was also benefited from obviously aggressive cost
reductions, as well as Baroid and Landmark had good quarters. In terms of just the overall completion
tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we don't expect that to
repeat in the first quarter.
David Anderson (Analyst - Barclays):
Okay.
Jef f Miller (President):
I think it's important -- let me just follow that up -- because our D&amp;E business is executing really well.
Those guys are dead focused on winning the right contracts. We're seeing the benefit of a lot of work in
key markets for all of our D&amp;E service lines.
David Anderson (Analyst - Barclays):
Do you think you can keep those margins where they are over the next couple quarters? In D&amp;E?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Well, we're taking it one quarter at a time and we'll just have to see.
David Anderson (Analyst - Barclays):
Fair enough. Thanks.

Bill Herbert (Analyst - Simmons &amp; Company):
Dave, with regard to your cost structure, you extolled an exceedingly realistic outlook for 2016,
international down as much as 20% and North America down anywhere from 30% to 50%. Given the
adjustments that you've made over the preceding two quarters, are you right-sized for this expected
level of activity in 2016 now?

We are always reducing costs and so, as Dave described, it is a moving target, but there are still a
number of areas where we continue to work on reducing costs, both at the variable cost, as well as
around some of those sustainable fixed cost items like refining our maintenance processes takes out cost,
value engineering exercises that are taking place. We, in one case, took more than 20% of the cost out
of 20 products. So we're constantly, as I say, reviewing the structure, but I do believe these are things
that best position Halliburton for the recovery.
Bill Herbert (Analyst - Simmons &amp; Company):
Okay. And two housekeeping items for me to end it. (inaudible) Gulf of Mexico year-end completion tool
sales and then also depreciation. Why is it going up when your capital spending is going down by as
much as it is in 2016?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Because of additional CapEx. So obviously, there is a layering effect on the CapEx. On your first question,
what was the first question again, Bill? On the completion?
Bill Herbert (Analyst - Simmons &amp; Company):
Gulf of Mexico year-end sales, what was [amenited]?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
We're not going to provide that sort of detail. As I pointed out in the prepared remarks, the margin
increase in North America has been due to both the completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and also
the impact of cost reductions that we did at the end of the third quarter. To give you just a little bit of
additional color, the sequential decrementals for the US land in the fourth quarter was in the very low
single digits. So as you can see, there has been a significant contribution from the cost cuts that we did in
the third quarter.
Bill Herbert (Analyst - Simmons &amp; Company):
Very good. Thank you.
Operator:
Scott Gruber, Citigroup.
Scott Gruber (Analyst - Citigroup):
I want to circle back to the international margin risk as this is very top of mind for investors currently.
Obviously, your margins have proven very resilient, so kudos to you and your team. But this does lead
some investors to believe that your clients abroad will simply continue to ask for larger and larger
concessions until you're down to very thin margins. Can you just comment conceptually on why this risk is
low to help allay these fears in the marketplace?
Jef f Miller (President):
I think the investment internationally, at least by Halliburton, we were always sizing largely to the market
that we saw. It's a little bit different than maybe what we saw in North America and so I think that our
ability to pull levers internationally in key markets is probably more focused. And again, I think the ability
to size as we move along will bode well for us.

Let me just add a little color to that. Of course the way you do business between international markets
and the US market is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've gotten
in the US, the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time
between when you can price what does a frac cost, or what does drilling cost, or what does a mud job
cost is very dynamic, very real time and it's very transactional. The international market still continues to
be a long-term contract market, so the discussions that you have with customers around price
concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract,
which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what
you're delivering is adding value, or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and
therefore reduce their cost per BOE. And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those
things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in
North America is quite faster than it does in the international market and therefore, I think the margins
will stay up at a higher level and not be compressed down to US levels.
Scott Gruber (Analyst - Citigroup):
That's good color. How should we think about the contract real risk then over the medium term,
especially in light of these pricing concessions? If I recall, the contract role risk was material last recovery
period. The starting point for pricing was obviously very high going into 2009, but just given the
renegotiations that are ongoing today, does this minimize the contract role risk as we think about
potential recovery in 2017, 2018?
Jef f Miller (President):
I think the -- this is an international question?
Scott Gruber (Analyst - Citigroup):
Yes, focused on international, yes.
Jef f Miller (President):
Yes, and so one of the things that we typically see internationally obviously that cycle lags the US cycle,
and again these are also economies, in many cases, that are built around production of oil and gas and
so from an activity perspective, they tend to be, on a relative basis, more resilient. The second thing it
does is it does provide the opportunity to better manage the work with some visibility, which helps us
support margins and the second work with clients who are committed to a level of activity to then
optimize that level of activity and that serves, I think, both our customers and us.
Scott Gruber (Analyst - Citigroup):
Great. Thanks.

Dan Boyd (Analyst - BMO Capital Markets):
Dave, can you update us on your mature field strategy, the opportunities you are seeing in this market?
And then, specifically, maybe tie that to Latin American margin projections going forward. I was under the
assumption that mature fields was becoming a bigger piece of the pie in Latin America, so I'm wondering
if once you adjust cost to the lower level of activity, can we actually see margins trend higher after the
first quarter?

Dave Lesar (CEO):
Thanks. These are a good opportunity and we're seeing more of them. But I would say they are still on a
relative basis a small part of our business. Market conditions are creating demand for these sorts of
investments, but clearly they bring a different risk profile. And so with that, they've got to have some key
criteria like good rocks, good terms and service pullthrough. And so when we look in a commodity price
like the one today, these projects will be more challenged and what happens in those is we'll slow down
activity around those the same as any operator would.
Dan Boyd (Analyst - BMO Capital Markets):
Okay. And then unrelated follow-up, but can you give us an update on the additional costs you're
carrying in North America in preparation for the Baker acquisition?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
The costs associated with the service delivery platform that we're keeping intact remains essentially the
same in the last two quarters. It ran somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points and it remains at that
level in the fourth quarter.
Dan Boyd (Analyst - BMO Capital Markets):
Okay, thanks.

Kurt Hallead, RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead (Analyst - RBC Capital Markets):
I was curious on the CapEx front, at $1.6 billion, how would we characterize say maintenance as a
percentage of that?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
We really don't look at it that way. Most of the maintenance expenditure is actually expensed and as
such, our CapEx is pretty much based on the line-of-sight contracts and also the implementation of our
strategic initiatives like the [QTEM].
Kurt Hallead (Analyst - RBC Capital Markets):
Okay. And then you expect that $1.6 billion -- I know there is a lot of change in the marketplace, clearly,
but that $1.6 billion, you feel confident is based on existing contracts and not much movement on that
going forward?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Yes, yes. Let me give you an indication of how we run our capital program. Our capital program, as I said,
is based on line-of-sight contracts, as well as the implementation of strategic initiatives. But as you know,
we manufacture our own equipment. That gives us really a good ability to ramp down and ramp up
depending on the market conditions that we're seeing. So if you recall, in 2015, we began the year with
guiding to flat CapEx to 2014 and ended up being down about 30% versus 2014. So that manufacturing
capability has become a significant advantage here in this environment. So the fact that we can ramp up
and ramp down, we're going to adjust our CapEx program depending on the market conditions that we're
seeing in 2016, and if we do so, we will communicate that to the street.

Kurt Hallead (Analyst - RBC Capital Markets):
All right, thanks. And then a follow-up would be you mentioned, Christian, North American decremental
margins in low single digits during the fourth quarter. Do you feel you guys are at a point where the
combination of your cost-reduction efforts and maybe good handle on where this market may be
heading, is that the decrementals you would continue to expect in North America as you move forward?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Well, we take it one quarter at a time, Kurt, if you think about Q1. If you look at our decrementals for the
whole year in 2015, it was -- for North America -- it was about 40%. And if you do the math implied by our
guidance for Q1, the sequential decrementals would be less than that, which incorporates the lower
activities from a continuing decline in the US rig count, as well as not having the completion tools repeat
in the first quarter. So we're taking it one quarter at a time.
Kurt Hallead (Analyst - RBC Capital Markets):
Okay. That's great color. I do appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator:
Sean Meakim, JPMorgan.
Sean Meakim (Analyst - JP Morgan):
On your international margin performance, I was just trying to look at it a little bit differently. I'm curious
how much of the mix shift between offshore and onshore and spend the last couple of years has helped
your margins and how that could be a benefit going forward.
Jef f Miller (President):
I think it's more of a shift between exploration and development may have a bigger impact than maybe
onshore or offshore. Onshore is certainly an important and growing piece of our business in certain
markets. But when we get to not only drilling, but also completions of the development space is right in
our wheelhouse and we've seen, as the markets have contracted, quite a move that direction.
Dave Lesar (CEO):
If I can add to that, if you look at where Europe/Africa would have the most concentration of offshore is
really the weakest. However, we also saw outperformance in that region and the Middle East/Asia has the
highest concentration of mature fields and we also outperformed in that region. So both regions have
been outperforming both on the onshore and offshore segments of our business.
Sean Meakim (Analyst - JP Morgan):
Right. Those are fair points. Thank you. And then just back to North America. On Frac of the Future, do
you guys have an update of where your Q10 mix stands today and what you think it would look like at the
end of the year based on the new CapEx guide?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Right. At the end of the year, we had -- about 60% of our fleet is Q10, so actually that's higher than what
we've guided during our Analyst Day. We said 50% by the end of 2016. We are at 60% right now and
based on our capital plan, it should reach close to 75% by the end of 2016.

Michael LaMotte (Analyst - Guggenheim):
Dave, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the comment in the press release about the CGG
collaboration? What is entailed in that agreement and where you think it goes?
Jef f Miller (President):
Look, we're excited about that arrangement and we think it's a great combination. A couple of points
though, I think it demonstrates the value of DecisionSpace and its ability to adapt to and help in seismic
interpretation. It also, I think, the relationship, advances our position there and our access to data to
further develop [fab] software and serve a broader group of customers. The other thing that it does from
our perspective is it puts us in the seismic interpretation part of that business where we believe it is --
where there is a lot of value, but then keeps us out of the seismic acquisition business.
Michael LaMotte (Analyst - Guggenheim):
Is there any potential pullthrough on other services you think once you are in the door at the
interpretation level?
Jef f Miller (President):
Well, I think that we'll work together, but I think the ability to advance the software and have bigger data
sets to work with will always pull through, probably more in the software space than more traditional
services, but clearly we believe this is a positive move by Landmark.
Michael LaMotte (Analyst - Guggenheim):
Thanks, Jeff.

Jim Wicklund (Analyst - Credit Suisse):
How long will it take the industry to respond if oil prices one day were to go up and activity one day
started to move up? How long would it take the industry to recover 15% of activity in terms of people, but
industry overall?
Jef f Miller (President):
I'd love to have that conversation with you. I think that it would be a real mix of response and by that I
mean the service industry broadly has been beaten up pretty good at what we believe are unsustainable
prices. But I think from our perspective, at least at Halliburton, I'm confident that we would respond quite
quickly. If you recall, it was just 2014 when we hired more than 20,000 people onto the payroll at
Halliburton. And then the way we're taking care of our equipment now, I talked about the maintenance
processes and the Q10 pumps. Our ability to respond would be fairly quick.

Okay. I appreciate that. And you talk about slower velocity in the international sector. We've seen guys
like Chevron and obviously Pemex in Brazil cut CapEx. Usually they are done, like I said, more on a lower
velocity level, more annual, longer-term contracts. US onshore can react immediately. How long will it
take the NOCs and IOCs to start to pick up activity? Will it take an annual turn?
Jef f Miller (President):
Again, you're right that that velocity is slower, but at the same time it doesn't slow down as quickly. So
typically, we seen that about a six-month lag behind the US internationally in terms of activity build,
though it just tends to be more stable. A lot of government approval is required and partner requirements
to get that ramped up. But inside of existing projects, I would say within six months to a year that activity
could pick back up.
Jim Wicklund (Analyst - Credit Suisse):
Six months to a year, okay. My unrelated follow-up, how many lower tertiary completions do you expect
to do this year versus how many did you do last year?
Jef f Miller (President):
Look, again, a bit of a moving target, so I won't comment. If you think about it though as the lower tertiary
is certainly a positive piece of our business. We love our position there with our ESTMZ and some of our
other capability in the lower tertiary.
Jim Wicklund (Analyst - Credit Suisse):
Okay, gentlemen. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Rob Mackenzie, Iberia Capital.
Rob Mackenzie (Analyst - Iberia Capital):
My question -- I guess it's for Christian -- on receivables. Can you give us a feel for how much of your
receivables might be with E&amp;P companies that are distressed or at risk of being distressed to get a
feel for the risk we might see for capital accounts?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
As Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks, one of the key tenets of our strategy is customer alignment
and based on that, the concentration of our customer in North America, 17 customers represent 50% of
our revenues and those are the largest companies with better balance sheets that can withstand this
downturn. Now, as such, we don't have much exposure to the smaller guys, not to say that we're totally
immune, but there is much, much lower than other service providers in the market today.
Rob Mackenzie (Analyst - Iberia Capital):
Okay. And my related follow-up I guess would be a similar question -- internationally, vis-a-vis, NOCs such
as [Pedivesa], Pemex, etc.?
Christian Garcia (CFO):
Absolutely. There is no question they have been slow paying. In fact, if you look at their [base] working
capital, that's gone up. Good to say that we lead in that metric and I think we've widened the gap
against our peers. But in terms of international, those are the largest companies in the world and we

Jef f Miller (President):
Thank you, Danielle. So I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of key points. First, we continue to
manage the near term, controlling costs while managing to our clients' fluid capital spend outlooks.
Second, we remain committed to positioning Halliburton for the recovery, which means delivering
efficient technology that lowers the cost per BOE for our clients, while aligning with those clients with
stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage positions. I thank you. I look forward to talking with you
again next quarter. Danielle, you can close out the call.
Operator:
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes
